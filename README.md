# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. I've chosen to go with the approach of adding all of my config files, and then relying on manually symlinking them
into my home directory. Once I have a working setup I might work on creating a bootstrapping script. Some homebrew automatization would also be great. One can dream.

#antigen
I've moved from using oh-my-zsh to using antigen for my zsh setup. The antigen repo is added as a submodule.
